Beep. Beep. I'm VOLUNTRON-4000. An improved version of myself.

Now I'm faster, more agile, I know how to say "hello", and I'm really COOL.

However... Beep. That last update made me want to order EVERYTHING. Beep.

I'm going to receive a number, a boolean, and a string of characters. These values are not in alphabetical order by their datatype (in Spanish). This cannot be!

Help me sort these values according to their datatype alphabetical order (in Spanish): booleano, cadena, número.

#Input

You will receive three values separated by a space ` `:

- First value will be a Number (use `scanner.nextInt()`)
- Second value will be a Boolean (use `scanner.nextBoolean()`)
- Third value will be a String (use `scanner.next()`)

#Output

Print the values in the following order: Boolean (represented by X), then the String (represented by Y), and, lastly, the number (represented by Z). Use the following format:

```
Booleano -> X
Cadena -> Y
Número -> Z
```

# Examples

||input
123 True agua
||output
Booleano -> True
Cadena -> agua
Número -> 123
||description
This is the resulting output after using the values that you read.
||end
